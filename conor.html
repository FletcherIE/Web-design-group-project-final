         <h2 class ="h2conor">Morning blitz</h2>
         <p id ="para1"><span style="color: blue">The most important thing to do with your day is start off on the right foot. Make your bed before anything else.That way even if you have had a not so productive day, You can return to a made bed. This is the first step in achieveing a routine. Grab yourself a nice cup of your preferred caffenined beverage and get to work on reading 7-10 pages of your favourite book. This is an excellent way to stimulate the brain,relax the mind and get the creative juices flowing all  in one fell swoop. After, Do up a small task list for the day that you know you can achieve. Dont set unachievable goals! Start small (like making your bed ;)) and work up to the more arduous tasks to finish. This will instinctivly give you a sense of accomplishment and set you on a snowball affect. </span></p>

         <p id "para2"><span style="color: blue">Statistics show our brains process information best in 25 minute incriments. You are not a superhuman that can process endless drones of information and retain it effectively. Use the break method! Set a subtask section in your journal for the topics you would like to revise over for the day and set break times. It dosent have to be a lon break as you dont want to drift out of focus. Take 10 minutes, Have a glass of water or catch up on your
           socials in this time. Then when your break ends, Get back into study mode. </span></p>

         <p><span style="color: blue">Last and definitely not least, Your sleep! Get. It. Getting a full nights sleep is paramount to your brains process of retaining all the information you have soaked in over the day.Make sure to cut your eyes off from any phones or tv's an hour before you plan to sleep. This will help you fall into a deeper sleep further enabling your brain to do its job while you rest. You've done your work. Enjoy that sleep.</p>
